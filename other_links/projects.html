			<dd>The project aims to investigate the relationship between vaccination rate and political preference based on the U.S. with three discrete datasets. If a significant difference could be observed for this sample, machine learning models, such as a classifier model for countries/states/counties, could be created to infer the ruling ideology in a given area. The labels will be predicted by this model according to the vaccination rate (defined below) of the given area. This label may be used to raise awareness about the shortcomings of the ruling party in preventing the spread of the pandemic. These parties may then be called to encourage the people about vaccination.</dd>
